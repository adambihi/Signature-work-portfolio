Now if I were analyze the interactive multimedia project from a domain specific point of view, there is a few ways to go about it. One of the points I want to highlight is, the human reflex aspect of the snake game. An average human's reaction time is around 250-300 milliseconds. Similar to other reaction based games, the snake game is built on the goal of testing a players cognitive ability to react to score. On average, someone with a faster reaction time should be able to score more points. That is if they are able to control the keyboard properly. This challenge has the ability to not only test a player's real word reflexes, but can also improve it with practice. By repeatedly playing a game such as the snake game, a player would be able to drastically improve their hand-eye coordination which could in turn, impact their day to day lives and professions.
